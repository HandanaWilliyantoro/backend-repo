1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install dependencies by running `npm install`.
3. Set up Firebase for your project and configure Firebase Functions.
4. Configure Firebase Admin SDK for server-side authentication and database access.
5. Start the development server by running `npm start` or `npm run start:local` for local development with nodemon.

## Scripts
